## Thanks for checking out my GitHub, I'm Chris ✌️

I'm a Software engineering student at Western Univerity, and currently working as a Software developer intern at J.D power's Autodata division.

You usually find me working in C++, Java or JavaScript, and I have a particular interest in graphics programming, gamedev, embedded systems and web development.

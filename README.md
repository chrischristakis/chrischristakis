## Thanks for checking out my GitHub, I'm Chris ‚úåÔ∏è

I'm a Software engineering student at Western Univerity, and currently working as a Software developer intern at J.D power's Autodata division.
You'll typically find me working in C++ or Java on graphics programming, using OpenGL to exploit the GPU and do some pretty neat stuff. Also been dabbling in Fullstack web development recently, typically using the MERN stack.

If you wanna talk over a coffee (or tea, which I definitely prefer üçµ) feel free to reach out to me at <a href="mailto:chriscchristakis@gmail.com">chriscchristakis@gmail.com</a>
